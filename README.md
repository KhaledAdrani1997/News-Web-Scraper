# A scraper for mosaique fm

A simple python API that scrapes articles from the Tunisian Mosaique fm Website. 

## Usage

Use the command below to launch the scraper. This is for Windows 10.

```bash
python.exe scraper_mosaique.py
```

By the end of execution, you will find the two scraped content in two csv files, one for arabic and the other for frensh.


## What's next
I'll try to improve the code from time to time. I'll work also on a way to add a column describing the 'type' of the extratced article in the output files.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
